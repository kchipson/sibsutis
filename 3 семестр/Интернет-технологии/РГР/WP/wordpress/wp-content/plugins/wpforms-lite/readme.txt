= Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder =

We were tired of the bloated and buggy contact form builder plugins. That's why we built WPForms to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create custom contact forms in minutes.

> Bill Erickson - Expert WordPress Consultant

= Pre-built Form Templates =

Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?

Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it's often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.

Whether you're looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.

WPForms comes with <a href="https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.

See <a href="https://wpforms.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">150+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demo</a>

= Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed =

WPForms' contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed - Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.

You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.

You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.

The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.

With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br>
> David Henzel - Co-founder of MaxCDN

= Surveys & Polls =

Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.

Our <a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).

WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.

The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.

Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.

Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.

= Membership and Default WordPress Forms =

Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.

For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/">membership sites</a>.

For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricited to logged-in users only.

Even if you're not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.

Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testiomnials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.

= Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More =

While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, and more.

WPForms integrates with both PayPal and Stripe, so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you're using SSL, then you can use our Stripe Payment form to accept credit card payments. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.

Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shit order forms, online booking forms, and more.

= Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results =

With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">See Form Pages Demo</a>).

To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href="https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion" rel="friend">See Conversaional Forms Demo</a>).
