== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I define my own substitutions? =

Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
function my_cyr_to_lat_table( $ctl_table ) {
   $ctl_table['Ъ'] = 'U';
   $ctl_table['ъ'] = 'u';

   return $ctl_table;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_table', 'my_cyr_to_lat_table' );
`

= How can I redefine non-standard locale ? =

For instance, if your non-standard locale is uk_UA, you can redefine it to `uk` by adding the following code to your theme's `function.php` file:

`
/**
 * Use conversion table for non-standard locale.
 *
 * @param array $table Conversion table.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function my_ctl_table( $table ) {
	if ( 'uk_UA' === get_locale() ) {
		$settings = new Cyr_To_Lat_Settings();
		$table    = $settings->get_option( 'uk' );
	}

	return $table;
}
add_filter( 'ctl_table', 'my_ctl_table' );
`

= How can I convert a large number of posts/terms using wp-cli? =

Use the following command in console:

`
wp cyr2lat regenerate [--post_type=<post_type>] [--post_status=<post_status>]
`

Where
  `-post_type` is list of post types,
  `-post_status` is list of post statuses.
